Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game

Description: This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O". The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winning combination, the game results in a draw.

Real-Time Feedback: The game dynamically updates the board and checks for a win or draw after each move.
Winning Message: A popup shows whether "X" or "O" wins or if itâ€™s a draw.
Restart Button: Players can reset the game to play again.
Hover Effects: Visual indicators show whose turn it is, enhancing the user experience.
